# GA4 | Technique: Funnel Exploration

 One of the most improved features of Google Analytics 4 is the funnel analysis. It is much better. Previous versions of Google Analytics funnels were really inflexible. They really only worked if your site just happened to line up exactly how they were designed to work, and most of them didn't. The new version pulls in features that were previously only available in the enterprise version, and it's actually even a little bit better. So for now, for free, you are getting a better funnel analysis tool than you get in the $150,000 enterprise license.

I think these funnels are incredibly powerful. I encourage you to add a few for whatever flows that you're tracking for your users.
